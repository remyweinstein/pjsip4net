Things to come.
 * Version 0.1.
  * Refactor interop code to be completely independent of core pjsip libraries. It will let to choose .Net bindings and underlying pjsip dll version avoiding changes in application code. Pjsip developers consider rolling out their own .Net bindings generated by means of SWIG. It could be used. 
  * Mono build.
